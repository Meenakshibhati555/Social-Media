1) Memoization: useMemo caches the result of expensive calculations to enhance performance.

2) Re-computation : Only re-computes the memoized value when specific dependencies changes.

3) Optimization : Helps prevent unnecessary recaluations, improving components rendering efficiency.

4) Dependendy Array : Uses an array of dependencies to determine when to recompute the cached value.

5) Comparison with useCallback : While useCallback memozies functions, useMemo memozies values or result of functions.

6) Best Use : Ideal for intensive compitations or operations that should'n;t run on every render.
